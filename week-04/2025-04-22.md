# Multiple View Geometry 

Tasks for Today
* Burning 64 GB flash card for raspberry pi for hexapod robot
* Add MATLAB files for Hartley-Zisserman and commit to GitHub
* Load black and white PGM files for edge detection in Python code


## Download and Clone with GitHub Desktop

This seems the best

## Raspian OS Image

Using Desktop 64-bit for now

There's no way to extract `.xz` files on these computers,

I copied it into WSL, downloaded and installed `xz` command-line utility,
extracted it, and copied it back.

Lab 2238 classroom computers have SD card slots, I'm using the micro-SD adapter that came with my card.

There's no way I found to burn this image from the lab computers,
I will need to bring my own SD card reader next time and burn from my Mac,
or pre-burn SD cards.

Here is a more lightweight burner than Balena Etcher

I think there's a way to make removable storage available under WSL
if you were able to run as administrator, but I'd rather not press the issue at the moment.
