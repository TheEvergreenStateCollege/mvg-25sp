## Virtual Environments

On Mac and some other environments, like the Lab 2238 computers, you need to be in 
a Python virtual environment first to install packages of a particular version
without interfering with system Python.

```
. ~/path/to/venv/bin/activate
```

Install packages

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Test Text

We wrote some numbers and letters in sharpie and captured it in a piece of paper and webcam.
in `images/

## Run OpenCV and ocrmac script

$ python3 text_finder.py
ocrmac

A small Python wrapper to extract text from images on a Mac system. Uses the vision
framework from Apple. Simply pass a path to an image or a PIL image directly and get lists
of texts, their confidence, and bounding box.

This only works on macOS systems with newer macOS versions (10.15+).
