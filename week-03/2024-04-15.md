Last time:

This general approach to label a few point correspondences between two images will probably work:


Writing letters that are "small enough" to not take up the whole image, and "big enough" to read readable by OCR
no matter if they are rotated through affine transformations.

## Lucas Kanade

An important algorithm in MVG, tracking "optical flow" between two images.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas%E2%80%93Kanade_method

Uses "derivative of light change" to recover a matrix that changes image A or B.

Could this be used for our point labeling problem, or can we use it to verify that our robot has taken a step in the same
direction from image A to image B, as the matrix recovered from Lucas Kanade?

Here is a good example of Optical Flow and a code implementation from this medium article:
